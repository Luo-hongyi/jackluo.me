# **Welcome to the Best-Damn Portfolio You’ll See Today**

No Frameworks, No BS.

---

## **What in the Holy Monorepo Is This?**
This ain’t your nephew’s React spaghetti.
This is **vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript cold brew**—served over ice, no artisanal build tools needed.

> "Frameworks are for people who can’t read MDN." – Me, right now ☕️

## **Installation (If You’ve Ever Double-Clicked a .exe, You Can Handle This)**

```bash
# Method 1: Python stans
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Method 2: Node hipsters
npx serve .

# Method 3: Drag index.html into your browser
# Yes, really. It just works.
```

## **Edit Your Hype Without Regret**

1. **Open** `edit.html` (the UI so clean it flosses)
2. **Fill forms**—like LinkedIn, but without the doomscrolling
3. **Copy the generated JS**—no git push, no CI pipeline, no tears
4. **Refresh**. Boom. Mic drop.🎤

## **Deploy to Prod Faster Than a Zoom Meme**

| Platform          | Steps        | Time   |
|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| **GitHub Pages**  | Push        | 60s ⏱️ |
| **Netlify**       | Drag folder | 90s    |
| **Vercel**        | Fork & push | 120s   |

## **Performance? *Chef’s Kiss***

- **Lighthouse**: 100/100 (and it didn’t even cheat)
- **First Paint**: Faster than your ex’s rebound
- **Bundle Size**: If it gets any lighter, it’ll float off the server

---

## **Built With**

- **HTML5** – Grandma’s bones, still unbreakable
- **CSS Grid** – Like Bootstrap, except it’s not 2015
- **Vanilla JS** – No `node_modules` black hole.
